## Exercise 1.1

```
> 10
10
> (+ 5 3 4)
12
> (- 9 1)
8
> (/ 6 2)
3
> (+ (* 2 4) (- 4 6))
6
> (define a 3)
> (define b (+ a 1))
> (+ a b (* a b))
19
> (= a b)
#f
> (if (and (> b a) (< b (* a b)))
      b
      a)
4
> (cond ((= a 4) 6)
        ((= b 4) (+ 6 7 a))
        (else 25))
16
> (+ 2 (if (> b a) b a))
6
> (* (cond ((> a b) a)
           ((< a b) b)
           (else -1))
     (+ a 1))
16
```

## Exercise 1.2

```
(/ (+ 4
      (- 2
         3
         (+ 6
            (/ 4 5))))
   (* 3
      (- 6 2)
      (- 2 7)))
```

## Exercise 1.3

```
(define (sum-of-squares a b)
  (+ (* a a) (* b b)))

(define (f a b c)
  (cond ((and (< a b) (< a c)) (sum-of-squares b c)) ; a is smallest
        ((and (< b a) (< b c)) (sum-of-squares a c)) ; b is smallest
        (else (sum-of-squares a b))))                ; c is smallest
```

## Exercise 1.4

The procedure can be described as: Add b to a if b is greater than zero, otherwise subtract b from a.

## Exercise 1.5

An interpreter which uses applicative-order evaluation will run out of memory trying to expand `(p)`, while an interpreter which uses normal-order evaluation will never evaluate `(p)` since `(= x 0)` is `#t`.

## Exercise 1.6

When calling `new-if` the then-clause and else-clause are both evaluated regardless of the predicate resulting in infinite recursion. The regular `if` expression does not have this problem because it only evaluates one of the clauses, depending on the predicate. 

## Exercise 1.7

For very small numbers `good-enough?` will return `#t` even if the error is very large proportionally to the actual answer.

For very large numbers the act of squaring `x` will result in a very low precision number which will not satisfy `(< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))`.

```
(define (good-enough guess last-guess x)
  (< (abs (- guess last-guess)) (/ x 1000))
```

## Exercise 1.8

```
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (abs x) (if (> x 0) x (- x)))

(define (cube-root x)
  (cube-root-iter 0 1.0 x))

(define (cube-root-iter last-guess guess x)
  (cond ((good-enough? last-guess guess) guess)
        (else (cube-root-iter guess (improve-guess guess x) x))))

(define (improve-guess guess x)
  (/ (+ (/ x (square guess))
        (* 2 guess))
     3))

(define (good-enough? guess last-guess)
  (< (abs (- guess last-guess)) 0.001))
```

## Exercise 1.9

### Procedure A

```
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
9
```

This process is recursive.

### Procedure B

```
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9
```

This process is iterative.

## Exercise 1.10

```
> (define (A x y)
    (cond ((= y 0) 0)
          ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
          ((= y 1) 2)
          (else (A (- x 1)
                   (A x (- y 1))))))
> (A 1 10)
(A 0 (A 1 9))
(A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 1))))))))))
(* 2 (* 2 (* 2 (* 2 (* 2 (* 2 (* 2 (* 2 (* 2 2)))))))))
(expt 2 10)
1024
> (A 2 4)
(A 1 (A 2 3))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 1 (A 1 1))))
(expt 2 (expt 2 (expt 2 2))))
65536
> (A 3 3)
(A 2 (A 3 2))
(A 2 (A 2 (A 2 1)))
(A 2 (A 2 2))
(A 2 4)
(expt 2 (expt 2 (expt 2 2)))
65536
```

```
(define (f n) (A 0 n)) ; 2n
(define (g n) (A 1 n)) ; 2^n
(define (h n) (A 2 n)) ; 2^2^2... n times
```

## Exercise 1.11

```
(define (f n)
  (if (< n 3)
      n
      (+ (f (- n 1))
         (* 2 (f (- n 2)))
         (* 3 (f (- n 3))))))
```

```
(define (f n)
  (define (f-i a b c count)
    (cond ((< n 3) n)
          ((<= count 0) a)
          (else (f-i (+ a (* 2 b) (* 3 c)) a b (- count 1)))))
  (f-i 2 1 0 (- n 2)))
```
